# Polytonic tutorial
 his tutorial explains how to add Polytonic characters to an existing Monotonic Greek typeface. (In terms of the [Google Fonts Glyph Sets/Greek/](https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/tree/master/Lib/gftools/encodings/GF%20Glyph%20Sets/Greek) defined in 2017, we explain how to extend a Greek Core set into Greek Plus set.)
