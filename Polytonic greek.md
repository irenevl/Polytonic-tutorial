# Polytonic greek

## Introduction
This tutorial explains how to add Polytonic characters to an existing Monotonic Greek typeface. (In terms of the [Google Fonts Glyph Sets/Greek/](https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/tree/master/Lib/gftools/encodings/GF%20Glyph%20Sets/Greek) defined in 2017, we explain how to extend a Greek Core set into Greek Plus set.)

I hope to demystify polytonic type design and encourage type designers to add polytonic to their typefaces. Designing a small number of diacritics and following some positioning rules hopefully will make the expansion of greek set accessible more to type designers.
Adding polytonic Greek in contemporary typefaces has not been a priority today and that leaves us with a very small amount of choices when typesetting polytonic text and usually these choices are either based on the French style or Porsonic models, and rarely something more contemporary than 19th century style typefaces. 

This tutorial covers:

* the design of the required glyphs,
* technical information including character encoding,
* external resources of examples,
* external related material.

## Background

Polytonic Greek is the system of Greek orthography, using multiple diacritical marks, that for centuries was the standard for writing modern Greek. In January 1982 the Greek government declared a new official orthography, a “monotonic” system that retained only two diacritics. The current official standard uses the acute accent, generally referred to as tonos in the context of Greek, and the dieresis.

Despite the official change, and the vast majority of new Greek publishing being monotonic, polytonic orthography is a valid option for modern Greek typesetting — if not government approved. A daily newspaper, [Ἑστία](https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/Εστία_(εφημερίδα)) uses polytonic, traditional and religious publications are often published in polytonic, and activists campaign for its return more widely. Thus, as well as older texts, modern texts exist and are being produced that using polytonic characters that require polytonic fonts, and so a polytonic set is strongly recommended for system fonts and other fonts expected to perform on a wide variety of texts.

## Usage

This set adds all the accented letters, lower case and upper case, and the accents+breathings necessary to build these composites. It's basically what Unicode defines as “Greek Extended” with the addition of forgotten iota subscript (uni037A).

In this category I avoid adding the archaic numerals. The reason I'm doing that is this:
The specific archaic numerals, even if they aren't many, require special attention and research on behalf of the designer. These numerals are rarely used and most of the designers don't even know how to typeset them, hence the existing examples of these characters are, most of the time, really poorly designed. 

The Greek Plus set omits Greek archaic numerals, which are not used at all in modern Greek. They can be difficult to design, and 

basic Polytonic set is primarily because I want to promote the expansion of Greek character sets to Polytonic. Adding polytonic to a pre-existing greek set can be done almost entirely by the use of composites. Speeding up the process of creating polytonic greek fonts will give polytonic users the chance to typeset their text with a much wider variety of typefaces, and hopefully many a bit more modern looking than Didot :)

### upper case:
Polytonic greek is consisted by the addition of 96 Upper case

### lower case:
and 121 lower case composite glyphs.

These glyphs are build by monotonic upper and lower case combined with accents, breathings and other diacritics.
These are:

### accents:
- ´ oxia, U1FFD
- ` varia, U1FEF
- ῀ perispomeni, U1FC0
and macron and breve (vrachy) that we take from the latin set

### breathings:
- ᾿ psili, U1FBF
- ῾ dasia, U1FFE


### combinations:
- ῁ dialytica perispomeni, U1FC1
- ῍ psili varia, U1FCD
- ῎ psili oxia, U1FCE
- ῏ psili perispomeni, U1FCF
- ῝ dasia varia, U1FDD
- ῞ dasia oxia, U1FDE
- ῟ dasia perispomeni, U1FDF

### other diacritics:
- ͺ ypogegrammeni (iota subscript), U037A
- ι prosgegrammeni (iota adscript), U1FBE
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iota_subscript#Usage
### punctuation:
- ᾽ koronis, U1FBD
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_breathing#Coronis

## design of diacritics

### design of accents
The design of the polytonic accents are pretty straight forward. The oxia is identical with tonos from monotonic greek. That means that usually is a bit more upright than the latin acute.

The design of the grave follows the same principal and it is more upright than grave.

Perispomeni usually follows the shape of a tilde, but if the typeface is based on the Porson Greek model, then the tilde looks like a inverted breve. In some rare occasions appears straight like a macron.

Greek macron is identical to latin one.
Greek vrachy is identical to breve.


### design of breathings

Psili or smooth breathing takes the shape of a mirrored "c" shape or a quote/comma. Usually we prefer to keep it in the same dimensions and colour as the accents.

Dasia or rough breathing takes the shape of a "c" shape or a mirrored quote/comma. Usually it's a mirrored psili.

Both psili and dasia are placed over the initial vowel, or over the second vowel of an initial diphthong. So we can never find them in the middle of the world (useful tip for kerning).

### design of combinations
The rest of the diacritics are combinations of accents, breathings and dieresis. Depending on the style of the font these are positioned closer or more apart between them.

### design of ypogegrammeni and prosgegrammeni
Before we talk about the form that these two marks take, we should clear up what these marks are.
************

### positioning of accents and breathings
The positioning of the accents and the breathings and their combinations is usually at the optical centre of the lower case glyphs. The bottom tip or the middle of the pair of these diacritics marks should "point" at the centre of the glyph.
In the upper case, the diacritics are hanging on the front of the glyphs like tonos in monotonic. The diacritics in upper case are not optional and the positioning at the front is not a stylistic preference.

### positioning of ypogegrammeni and prosgegrammeni
The ypogrammeni is placed always at the centre of the glyphs, lower and upper case, with the exception of the lower case eta that is aligned as much as possible with the left vertical stem of the letter.
Prosgegrammeni, with a use only in upper case, is always placed on the right side of the letter, in a distance to represent the natural distance that a lower case iota would have after a capital letter.


### design of koronis

Koronis or crash is a punctuation mark used to symbolise a type of contraction in which two vowels or diphthongs merge into one new vowel or diphthong. The shape that takes is exactly like psili mark. In modern Greek koronis is obsolete.

## Small caps for polytonic set 
Normally small caps in Greek behave identical to all capitals setting. This means that all the substitution of polytonic small caps glyphs are exactly the same as the monotonic ones.
All accents are omitted other than the dieresis. 
However, there are cases that we want to add a stylistic set of accented small caps. In that case the small caps will have to behave like the lower case and all the accents and breathings need to go on the top of the glyph.

### considerations
In general accented small cap might look strange to a native reader with the first look. The examples of accented uppercase lookalike shapes in Greek typography are rare so the use of them should be as a stylistic option instead of a mainstream usage.

### opentype features
Polytonic greek doesn't have extra opentype features compare to a monotonic greek font. Apart from when we want the font to deal with the subscript to adscript transformation for the uppercase and when are font has the option of accented small caps.
The most common way to deal with both issues is to introduce stylistic sets features that the necessary rules will apply.

## conclusions
Polytonic edition to contemporary typeface isn't something that designers find necessary most of the times. That leaves us with a very small amount of choices when one typesets polytonic text and usually these choices are either based on the French style or Porsonic models, and rarely something more contemporary than 19th century style typefaces. 
Hope of this tutorial is to demystify the complexity of the set and simplify the process as possible so we can see in the future more support in our fonts.
